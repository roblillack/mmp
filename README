== BUILDING MMP

Install Window Maker, GNU make, and pkg-config.

Modify the BACKENDS line in Makefile to suit your needs (unless you've
got a very underpowered machine, you probably want mplayer as the only
backend) and call `gmake` (or just `make` on GNU/Linux systems).
After that, copy 'mmp' somewhere.

If you don't have pkg-config installed, you have to alter WINGS_*, too,
in the Makefile. (Hint for Solaris users: Make shure blastwave's pkg-config
gets found by make, not /bin/pkg-config)

== CONFIGURING MMP

Configuration settings are stored in ~/.mmprc. Play with them
and insert something like the following settings to alter the
colors:

    colorListBackground = "#ffffff";
    colorSelectionBackground = "#ffffff";
    colorBaseBackground = "#aeaeaa";
    colorWindowBackground = "#aeaeaa";
    colorSelectionForeground = "#000000";
    colorPlayed = "#f0f0dc";
    colorTitle = "#800000";
    colorArtist = "#400000";
